[![Build Status](http://jenkins.breedencontrol.com:8080/job/OSpite/badge/icon)](http://jenkins.breedencontrol.com:8080/job/OSpite/)

oSPITE is an Open Source campaign manager for various table top campaign types. It's called oSPITE because it's written out of spite. That's correct. You read that right.

Based on Laravel and deployed on the GPL 2.0 license.

Will have more to come in the future.
